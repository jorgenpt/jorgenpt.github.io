  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had customers report errors like these, then this post
might be for you:</p>

<ul>

<p>In my <a href="/post/2014/05/26/self-contained-game-distribution-on-linux/">previous post about self-contained distributions</a>,
we started looking at how the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">steam-runtime project</a>
works. In this post, we&rsquo;ll make the steam-runtime work for us in a
self-contained distribution that you can ship without depending on
Steam.</p>

<p>I will present two possible ways of doing it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using <a href="/post/2014/05/28/steam-runtime-without-steam/#Solution.1:.The.wrapper.script">a wrapper script</a>.</li>
<li>Using <a href="/post/2014/05/28/steam-runtime-without-steam/#Solution.2:.Embedded.search.path">an &ldquo;embedded search path&rdquo;</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why you would prefer the second approach, that
section starts with a rundown of the benefits inherent to it!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Distributing a game on Linux can be a little intimidating, and there are
definitely pitfalls. The main problem is making sure your game runs on
all of your users&#8217; machines, and outside of hardware and drivers, the
root of the problem is usually one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>You make an assumption about what libraries are present on the system.</li>
<li>You make an assumption about what version of a library is present on the system.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is very easy to accidentally do, as adding <code>-lSDL2</code> to the linker&rsquo;s
command line might work perfectly fine on your machine, but you forgot
that you installed SDL2 by hand 4 months ago. Another cause could be
that while <strong>your</strong> Linux distribution came with SDL2 preinstalled,
another distribution (that your users use) might not. Finally, maybe
your distribution came with v2 of some library, but your users only have
v1.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid this is to make your game distribution &ldquo;hermetic,&rdquo;
meaning that it contains all of its own dependencies. There are two main
ways to achieve this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Statically linking with all of your dependencies.</li>
<li>Dynamically linking with all of your dependencies, and pointing the
system&rsquo;s runtime loader at a copy of the libraries you bundle with
your game.</li>
</ol>


<p>Statically linking comes with its own set of problems, so this post
talks about solving the problem with dynamic linking.</p>

<a name="Introducing.the.steam-runtime"></a>
<h2>Introducing the steam-runtime</h2>

<p>It turns out that Valve has already solved this problem in Steam with
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">something called the steam-runtime</a>. Contrary to what
its name indicates, it has <strong>no direct dependency on Steam nor does it
even assume that it is installed</strong>. It is merely a controlled set of
open source libraries (with some patches) and associated tools to use
those libraries &ndash; to make your game build hermetic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Mac and Linux have two similarly named concepts that both deal with
dynamic loading, that behave quite differently: <code>@rpath</code> (under Mac OS
X&rsquo;s dyld) and <code>DT_RPATH</code> (or just rpath, under Linux&#8217; ld.)</p>

<p>Having done development (and more importantly, deployment) on both of
these platforms, I&rsquo;ve experienced first-hand how those concepts can get
a little jumbled in your mind, so here&rsquo;s a brief overview.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> all my posts are simple markdown documents

also static output, which I can host anywhere else if I decide that I
don&rsquo;t like GitHub any more.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I&rsquo;m excited by the <a href="https://unrealengine.com/blog/welcome-to-unreal-engine-4">release of Unreal Engine 4</a> (by Epic Games), and I figured I&rsquo;d put a couple of my thoughts down in writing.</p>

<p>First, let me emphasize something that hasn&rsquo;t been clear about this release: While UE4 uses a subscription model, a continued subscription is only required to get access to updates. Even if you cancel your subscription, you <strong>retain license to use &amp; modify the engine</strong>. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Read the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/eula">second to last paragraph of section 3 in their EULA</a>. You still have to (of course) follow the EULA and pay Epic 5% of your revenue from using UE4, even if you don&rsquo;t have an active subscription. On the topic of the EULA: It is written in fairly accessible english. Yay!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people compare this release to Unity, and aside from differences in technology, one of the big things to note is that Unity keeps their source very close to their chest. If you&rsquo;re a Unity developer, and Unity Technologies goes away or the Unity engine has limitations that you care about but they don&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;re hosed unless you go the route of getting a custom source license (which I&rsquo;d guess isn&rsquo;t cheap). You have no source access, so you cannot easily remove those limitations, and you cannot add support for new (or old) platforms. The same thing was true for the Unreal Development Kit (UDK), which was the &ldquo;non-AAA&rdquo; license option for UE3, but for UE4 it looks like you&rsquo;ll never be locked down like that.</p>

<p>Lastly, Epic is trying to encourage an open development process &ndash; both by them and by their licensees. That&rsquo;s pretty cool &ndash; I cringe when I think about how many different times the same things have likely been implemented / fixed in the Source engine, both by Valve&rsquo;s licensees, but also Valve developers. Epic realizes that their advantage is not (mainly) their specific implementation, but the sheer amount of engineering effort that has been put into making UE4 what it is. If licensees actually contribute back, then that will further UE4.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don&rsquo;t speak on behalf of Valve Software, and I have no association with Epic Games. I have not looked at the source of Unreal Engine 4 (yet).</em></p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>On Friday I spoke at <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com">Droidcon UK 2012</a>, and it was my very first conference talk, titled <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com/2012/sessions/the-butler-did-it-continuously-building-enforcing-app-quality-using-jenkins/">The Butler Did It: Continuously building &amp; enforcing app quality using Jenkins</a>.</p>

<p>I did the talk together with <a href="http://chris.orr.me.uk/+">Christopher Orr</a>, and the topic was using <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins CI</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a> to improve app quality when building Android software. It also included a short rant about the Android NDK. I thought it went surprisingly well, especially considering I was fueled by only 5 hours of sleep!</p>

<p>The turn-out was great &ndash; every seat was occupied, and we got a lot of interest in the form of questions afterwards. Here you can find the source material for our talk &ndash; our slides are pretty light on text, so we also have a version with a more fleshed out version of our speaker notes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told by the Droidcon organizers that they&rsquo;ll publish the video from the talk. I&rsquo;ll post an update once that&rsquo;s available.</p>

<p>In addition, the demo doesn&rsquo;t have any audio or captioning so far, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll update soon with a narrated or captioned video.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Yesterday I asked two coworkers to play Arcane Deathmatch with me, to get an initial feel for what direction I&rsquo;m going in. It was a great experience, and a great motivator: I finished up a large amount of basic implementations of features in the last week, so that it&rsquo;d be ready for the playtest.</p>

<p>I <strong>highly</strong> recommend doing this early for people working on hobby projects &ndash; it helps you focus on shipping and creating a real product, and motivate you. During the time leading up to the play-testing, I started thinking of every issue I&rsquo;ve filed in the bugtracker in terms of &ldquo;how important is this to testing gameplay&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Some very useful things I learned include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Controls need to be thought about very carefully, and tested on real people. What seems fine when you&rsquo;re just testing around the environment is experienced completely differently when you&rsquo;re in an action-packed fight.</li>
<li>While art is not important to the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; in this concept, UX is very important &ndash; even early on. People need to find the information and actions they care about!</li>
<li>Pacing is very important, and hard to get right &ndash; there are a <em>lot</em> of factors that influence it, many of which I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to implementing yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>There were a lot of other subtle bugs and improvements I found through this little hour of gameplay. As an example, camera movement is currently not animated, which makes Teleport <strong>very</strong> jarring.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m back to implementing some new content (especially a more interesting level and more spells) &ndash; and then I can get a better feel for how pacing and balancing needs to be done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>While work is keeping me busy, over the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a couple of good evenings to work on Arcane Deathmatch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The last few months it&rsquo;s been busy with three weddings (including my own) and a vacation. Every once in a while I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with a game prototype with a smaller scope than Dungeon Fodder &ndash; and now I&rsquo;ve finally reached a point where I can say that I&rsquo;ll be pursuing this concept instead of Dungeon Fodder. I first had to make sure Unity&rsquo;s (fairly lacking) networking APIs would be suitable for developing this.</p>

<p>The game is tentatively named &ldquo;Arcane Deathmatch&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s a third person / top down, fast paced, RPG-inspired multiplayer action game. The gameplay is similar to the Warcraft 3 custom map &ldquo;Warlocks&rdquo; (I think?): You control a wizard/warlock on a relatively small battlefield. You&rsquo;re pitted against a few adversaries, all of you armed with whatever spells you&rsquo;ve purchased. As you survive and kill off your opponents you&rsquo;re awarded gold with which to purchase new spells between rounds.</p>

<p>Every time you&rsquo;re hit by a spell, you lose some health and get knocked back. The less health you have, the easier you are to knock around. If you get knocked off the map, you&rsquo;ll probably sustain damage wading through a lava pit, be nibbled on by piranhas as you swim to shore, or fall off the map.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve got rudimentary networking and gameplay working &ndash; two or more players can connect to eachother and fight it out (armed with Magic Missile!), and getting knocked off the map means falling to your death. It doesn&rsquo;t look like much &ndash; but that&rsquo;s never stopped me before! ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Vital things that are missing are more spells, rewards, a way to buy said spells, more interesting maps / terrain / obstacles, and a scoreboard. (Probably in that order)</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll follow my blog as I post status updates and my experiences developing this game :&ndash;)</p>
