  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Mac and Linux have two similarly named concepts that both deal with
dynamic loading, that behave quite differently: <code>@rpath</code> (under Mac OS
X&rsquo;s dyld) and <code>DT_RPATH</code> (or just rpath, under Linux&#8217; ld.)</p>

<p>Having done development (and more importantly, deployment) on both of
these platforms, I&rsquo;ve experienced first-hand how those concepts can get
a little jumbled in your mind, so here&rsquo;s a brief overview.</p>

comes to a blog, I&rsquo;d really like to own my own data, and that tumblr&rsquo;s
feature-set has bothered me in the past (with no way of improving it.)</p>

<p>With <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> all my posts are simple markdown documents
managed <a href="https://github.com/jorgenpt/jorgenpt.github.io">in a git repository</a>, that gets transformed into

also static output, which I can host anywhere else if I decide that I
don&rsquo;t like GitHub any more.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I&rsquo;m excited by the <a href="https://unrealengine.com/blog/welcome-to-unreal-engine-4">release of Unreal Engine 4</a> (by Epic Games), and I figured I&rsquo;d put a couple of my thoughts down in writing.</p>

<p>First, let me emphasize something that hasn&rsquo;t been clear about this release: While UE4 uses a subscription model, a continued subscription is only required to get access to updates. Even if you cancel your subscription, you <strong>retain license to use &amp; modify the engine</strong>. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Read the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/eula">second to last paragraph of section 3 in their EULA</a>. You still have to (of course) follow the EULA and pay Epic 5% of your revenue from using UE4, even if you don&rsquo;t have an active subscription. On the topic of the EULA: It is written in fairly accessible english. Yay!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people compare this release to Unity, and aside from differences in technology, one of the big things to note is that Unity keeps their source very close to their chest. If you&rsquo;re a Unity developer, and Unity Technologies goes away or the Unity engine has limitations that you care about but they don&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;re hosed unless you go the route of getting a custom source license (which I&rsquo;d guess isn&rsquo;t cheap). You have no source access, so you cannot easily remove those limitations, and you cannot add support for new (or old) platforms. The same thing was true for the Unreal Development Kit (UDK), which was the &ldquo;non-AAA&rdquo; license option for UE3, but for UE4 it looks like you&rsquo;ll never be locked down like that.</p>

<p>Lastly, Epic is trying to encourage an open development process &ndash; both by them and by their licensees. That&rsquo;s pretty cool &ndash; I cringe when I think about how many different times the same things have likely been implemented / fixed in the Source engine, both by Valve&rsquo;s licensees, but also Valve developers. Epic realizes that their advantage is not (mainly) their specific implementation, but the sheer amount of engineering effort that has been put into making UE4 what it is. If licensees actually contribute back, then that will further UE4.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don&rsquo;t speak on behalf of Valve Software, and I have no association with Epic Games. I have not looked at the source of Unreal Engine 4 (yet).</em></p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>On Friday I spoke at <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com">Droidcon UK 2012</a>, and it was my very first conference talk, titled <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com/2012/sessions/the-butler-did-it-continuously-building-enforcing-app-quality-using-jenkins/">The Butler Did It: Continuously building &amp; enforcing app quality using Jenkins</a>.</p>

<p>I did the talk together with <a href="http://chris.orr.me.uk/+">Christopher Orr</a>, and the topic was using <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins CI</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a> to improve app quality when building Android software. It also included a short rant about the Android NDK. I thought it went surprisingly well, especially considering I was fueled by only 5 hours of sleep!</p>

<p>The turn-out was great &ndash; every seat was occupied, and we got a lot of interest in the form of questions afterwards. Here you can find the source material for our talk &ndash; our slides are pretty light on text, so we also have a version with a more fleshed out version of our speaker notes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told by the Droidcon organizers that they&rsquo;ll publish the video from the talk. I&rsquo;ll post an update once that&rsquo;s available.</p>

<p>In addition, the demo doesn&rsquo;t have any audio or captioning so far, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll update soon with a narrated or captioned video.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Yesterday I asked two coworkers to play Arcane Deathmatch with me, to get an initial feel for what direction I&rsquo;m going in. It was a great experience, and a great motivator: I finished up a large amount of basic implementations of features in the last week, so that it&rsquo;d be ready for the playtest.</p>

<p>I <strong>highly</strong> recommend doing this early for people working on hobby projects &ndash; it helps you focus on shipping and creating a real product, and motivate you. During the time leading up to the play-testing, I started thinking of every issue I&rsquo;ve filed in the bugtracker in terms of &ldquo;how important is this to testing gameplay&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Some very useful things I learned include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Controls need to be thought about very carefully, and tested on real people. What seems fine when you&rsquo;re just testing around the environment is experienced completely differently when you&rsquo;re in an action-packed fight.</li>
<li>While art is not important to the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; in this concept, UX is very important &ndash; even early on. People need to find the information and actions they care about!</li>
<li>Pacing is very important, and hard to get right &ndash; there are a <em>lot</em> of factors that influence it, many of which I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to implementing yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>There were a lot of other subtle bugs and improvements I found through this little hour of gameplay. As an example, camera movement is currently not animated, which makes Teleport <strong>very</strong> jarring.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m back to implementing some new content (especially a more interesting level and more spells) &ndash; and then I can get a better feel for how pacing and balancing needs to be done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>While work is keeping me busy, over the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a couple of good evenings to work on Arcane Deathmatch.</p>

<p>Last weekend I poked around with a second spell, &ldquo;Infernal Nova&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/e_HNPJ92-H0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>This Saturday I added a leader board, a gold reward when you kill someone, and fixed some bugs. Tonight I added a UI for shopping spells, made the leader board prettier, and added a Teleport spell. Woo! Check it out below:</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The last few months it&rsquo;s been busy with three weddings (including my own) and a vacation. Every once in a while I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with a game prototype with a smaller scope than Dungeon Fodder &ndash; and now I&rsquo;ve finally reached a point where I can say that I&rsquo;ll be pursuing this concept instead of Dungeon Fodder. I first had to make sure Unity&rsquo;s (fairly lacking) networking APIs would be suitable for developing this.</p>

<p>The game is tentatively named &ldquo;Arcane Deathmatch&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s a third person / top down, fast paced, RPG-inspired multiplayer action game. The gameplay is similar to the Warcraft 3 custom map &ldquo;Warlocks&rdquo; (I think?): You control a wizard/warlock on a relatively small battlefield. You&rsquo;re pitted against a few adversaries, all of you armed with whatever spells you&rsquo;ve purchased. As you survive and kill off your opponents you&rsquo;re awarded gold with which to purchase new spells between rounds.</p>

<p>Every time you&rsquo;re hit by a spell, you lose some health and get knocked back. The less health you have, the easier you are to knock around. If you get knocked off the map, you&rsquo;ll probably sustain damage wading through a lava pit, be nibbled on by piranhas as you swim to shore, or fall off the map.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/early_adm.png"></p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve got rudimentary networking and gameplay working &ndash; two or more players can connect to eachother and fight it out (armed with Magic Missile!), and getting knocked off the map means falling to your death. It doesn&rsquo;t look like much &ndash; but that&rsquo;s never stopped me before! ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Vital things that are missing are more spells, rewards, a way to buy said spells, more interesting maps / terrain / obstacles, and a scoreboard. (Probably in that order)</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll follow my blog as I post status updates and my experiences developing this game :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I&rsquo;ve attracted some people who are following the progress of this project, so I figured I should give a quick update on my (lack of) progress.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of organizing a wedding reception, so there won&rsquo;t be any time for working on my projects until after the 26th of June. I look forward to getting back to it!</p>

<p>So far, updates have been on a weekly schedule. I intend to continue with that pace &ndash; or maybe biweekly, depending on how much time I have. Right before this lack of updates began, I started prototyping a game based on some of the same concepts, but with a smaller scope. I might pursue that so that I have a playable, &ldquo;done&rdquo; game at an earlier point. If so, it&rsquo;ll be featured in an upcoming post. :)</p>

<p>Thank you all for your feedback and interest! This is exactly why I publish this publicly!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>(This is similar to <a href="/post/2012/03/02/requiring-a-minimum-version-of-the-android-ndk/">Requiring a minimum version of the Android NDK</a>, but for SDK versions)</p>

<p>Again, I was tinkering with our build system at work, which is a set of small Makefiles that are responsible for invoking ndk-build (to build our C component) and ant (for the Java component). These files also maintain the dependency graph for the cross-domain dependencies, so things like header files being generated from class-files using <code>javah</code> and APKs depending on the produced shared libraries.</p>

<p>I recently made some changes to the <code>ant</code> build step by creating <a href="https://gist.github.com/2878806">our own <code>custom_rules.xml</code></a>, exposing the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; -compile target. What I noticed was that <code>build.xml</code> only did an <code>&lt;import file="custom_rules.xml" optional="true" /&gt;</code> if you were on a fairly recent Android SDK version. This isn&rsquo;t a problem for our Jenkins builds, since we&rsquo;ve got an in-house system that ensures a strict version dependency between a specific source checkout and SDK/NDK versions, so they were always using the newer SDK. It was a problem for our developers &ndash; we&rsquo;ve yet to roll this system to our development machines, so developers are responsible for checking out and updating their own SDKs.</p>

<p>To prevent this from getting in the way, I wrote a little snippet of bash that&rsquo;s run from the Makefile, that ensures that the SDK version is at least the given version.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://gist.github.com/2878774">the shellscript as a gist on GitHub</a></p>

<p>Put the script into <code>assert_sdk_version.sh</code>, and put the following at the top of your <code>Makefile</code>, and voilà! Builds should now fail with a more understandable message if someone&rsquo;s using the wrong NDK version. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious how this works: It checks the <code>tools/source.properties</code> file in your Android SDK, looking for a line like <code>Pkg.Revision=XX</code>, and extracts the version (<code>XX</code>) from that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty straight forward, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything online on how to check the SDK version from the command line, so I figured I&rsquo;d share it.</p>
