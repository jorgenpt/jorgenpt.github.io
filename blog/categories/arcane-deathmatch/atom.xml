    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s the first &ldquo;dev diary&rdquo; video for Arcane Deathmatch.</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cYxfSR7fj2Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>So far the game has:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working networking</li>
<li>Simple network lobby</li>
<li>Basic UI - leaderboard, spell shop</li>
<li>Three initial spells (magic missile, infernal nova, teleport)</li>
<li>A very boring level</li>
<li>A reward system for kills</li>
<li>A round system with a &ldquo;last man standing&rdquo; victory condition</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I asked two coworkers to play Arcane Deathmatch with me, to get an initial feel for what direction I&rsquo;m going in. It was a great experience, and a great motivator: I finished up a large amount of basic implementations of features in the last week, so that it&rsquo;d be ready for the playtest.</p>

<p>I <strong>highly</strong> recommend doing this early for people working on hobby projects - it helps you focus on shipping and creating a real product, and motivate you. During the time leading up to the play-testing, I started thinking of every issue I&rsquo;ve filed in the bugtracker in terms of &ldquo;how important is this to testing gameplay&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Some very useful things I learned include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Controls need to be thought about very carefully, and tested on real people. What seems fine when you&rsquo;re just testing around the environment is experienced completely differently when you&rsquo;re in an action-packed fight.</li>
<li>While art is not important to the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; in this concept, UX is very important - even early on. People need to find the information and actions they care about!</li>
<li>Pacing is very important, and hard to get right - there are a <em>lot</em> of factors that influence it, many of which I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to implementing yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>There were a lot of other subtle bugs and improvements I found through this little hour of gameplay. As an example, camera movement is currently not animated, which makes Teleport <strong>very</strong> jarring.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m back to implementing some new content (especially a more interesting level and more spells) - and then I can get a better feel for how pacing and balancing needs to be done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While work is keeping me busy, over the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a couple of good evenings to work on Arcane Deathmatch.</p>

<p>Last weekend I poked around with a second spell, &ldquo;Infernal Nova&rdquo;:</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/e_HNPJ92-H0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>This Saturday I added a leader board, a gold reward when you kill someone, and fixed some bugs. Tonight I added a UI for shopping spells, made the leader board prettier, and added a Teleport spell. Woo! Check it out below:</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YFKmtO05VjU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll keep making steady progress and I can start very very early tests against real people this week or next.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few months it&rsquo;s been busy with three weddings (including my own) and a vacation. Every once in a while I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with a game prototype with a smaller scope than Dungeon Fodder - and now I&rsquo;ve finally reached a point where I can say that I&rsquo;ll be pursuing this concept instead of Dungeon Fodder. I first had to make sure Unity&rsquo;s (fairly lacking) networking APIs would be suitable for developing this.</p>

<p>The game is tentatively named &ldquo;Arcane Deathmatch&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s a third person / top down, fast paced, RPG-inspired multiplayer action game. The gameplay is similar to the Warcraft 3 custom map &ldquo;Warlocks&rdquo; (I think?): You control a wizard/warlock on a relatively small battlefield. You&rsquo;re pitted against a few adversaries, all of you armed with whatever spells you&rsquo;ve purchased. As you survive and kill off your opponents you&rsquo;re awarded gold with which to purchase new spells between rounds.</p>

<p>Every time you&rsquo;re hit by a spell, you lose some health and get knocked back. The less health you have, the easier you are to knock around. If you get knocked off the map, you&rsquo;ll probably sustain damage wading through a lava pit, be nibbled on by piranhas as you swim to shore, or fall off the map.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/early_adm.png"></p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve got rudimentary networking and gameplay working - two or more players can connect to eachother and fight it out (armed with Magic Missile!), and getting knocked off the map means falling to your death. It doesn&rsquo;t look like much - but that&rsquo;s never stopped me before! ;-)</p>

<p>Vital things that are missing are more spells, rewards, a way to buy said spells, more interesting maps / terrain / obstacles, and a scoreboard. (Probably in that order)</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll follow my blog as I post status updates and my experiences developing this game :-)</p>
