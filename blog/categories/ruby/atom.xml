    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I needed to whip together a simple little app to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; photos - a tool to quickly let me go through each photo in a directory and choose between &ldquo;thumbs up&rdquo; or &ldquo;boo&rdquo;, then give me a list of the ones I said &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to.</p>

<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d write this app in Ruby, but I have had only bad experiences trying to get a useful, good GUI written in either Ruby or Python. Years ago I looked into GTK, QT and WxWidgets, but none of them convinced me they were capable. So I googled around for &ldquo;simple GUI ruby&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Shoes&rdquo; caught my eye. I tried it out, and it was indeed simple, but sadly <strong>too</strong> simple. It was hellbent on not letting me do anything complex, even when it&rsquo;s &ldquo;intuitive behavior&rdquo; was wrong.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing Objective-C since last summer (<a href="http://grabbox.devsoft.no">GrabBox</a> is written in it), so I gave up on my Ruby track and tried putting something together using Interface Builder and Cocoa. To my amazement, writing the whole app took me much less time than researching &ldquo;simple&rdquo; GUI frameworks for Ruby: ~1 hour from scratch to working app:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/image_vetter.jpg"></p>

<p>Is this really the state of GUI frameworks for Ruby and the likes (say, Python and Perl) - or have things improved significantly since I last looked at GTK, WxWidgets and QT? Is there nothing that can even remotely compete with Interface Builder and Cocoa? I&rsquo;m by no means a fanboy, and I&rsquo;d love to be able to do this as efficiently in Ruby or Python! Please post a comment if you have any tips or thoughts on this. :)</p>

<p><em>If you wonder what was wrong with Shoes: Things like the image class <strong>only</strong> letting you load data by providing a path or an URL, and having some caching behavior that rendered the app very slow after changing the ~4MB displayed image tens of times.</em></p>
