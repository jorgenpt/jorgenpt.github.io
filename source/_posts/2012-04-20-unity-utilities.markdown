[Unity Utilities](https://github.com/jorgenpt/unity-utilities)

I've started sharing some of the generally applicable code I've developed for Dungeon Fodder [on GitHub](https://github.com/jorgenpt/unity-utilities). So far: PathMoveable, a path walker (using Unity's CharacterController) that uses [AngryAnt's Path](http://angryant.com/path/) for pathfinding.
