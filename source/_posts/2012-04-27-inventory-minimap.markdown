This week I've been deep in non-visible changes, working on a dungeon generator. While there's not any good visible output yet, here's the other stuff I had time to do this week:

Basic inventory, supports drag, still missing drop (and on-hover descriptions) ^_^

Initial minimap - should probably not render lighting etc, but it works!
