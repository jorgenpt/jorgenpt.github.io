I gave a brief presentation followed by a Q&A for a class at the [Academy of
Interactive Entertainment](https://aie.edu/) at their Seattle campus. It was
a part of their "Lunchbox Speaker" series where they host various speakers
from the game development industry.

It talks about some of the challenges we at [Undead Labs](https://www.undeadlabs.com)
encountered developing State of Decay 2, and both practical steps we took to address it as
well as some of my opinions on how to avoid or address those things in the future.

Here are the slides from that talk:
