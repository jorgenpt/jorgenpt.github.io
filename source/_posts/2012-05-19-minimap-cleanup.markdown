Didn't get too much done this week, but I cleaned up the minimap:

Minimap before:

Minimap after:

I also added a dungeon level indicator:

And finally I switched the non-player character to use the same AI engine as the zombies ([AngryAnt's Behave](http://angryant.com/behave)), though with a different behavior tree. So far this just means that the non-player character actually attacks enemies. Woo!

Hopefully I'll have time to make the inventory management more complete and do a dev diary this weekend. We'll see.
