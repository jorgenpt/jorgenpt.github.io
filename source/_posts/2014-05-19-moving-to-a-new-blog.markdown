I have decided to retire my old [tumblr blog][tumblr] in favor of this
new [octopress blog][blog]. The reason for doing so is both that when it
comes to a blog, I'd really like to own my own data, and that tumblr's
feature-set has bothered me in the past (with no way of improving it.)

With [octopress][octopress] all my posts are simple markdown documents
managed [in a git repository][gitrepo], that gets transformed into
static content. That way, I both have the raw input for my blog, but
also static output, which I can host anywhere else if I decide that I
don't like GitHub any more.

In addition, octopress is open source (and uses [jekyll][jekyll], an
excellent static site generator), so if I need / desire to change
anything, I can.

With this transition, my blog also needed a new domain. Peferably it
would be one I owned, so I can easily move the blog to another host if
it came to it, unlike what I could with my old tumblr blog.

I chose to use my tjer.no domain - and now the URL is jorgen.tjer.no!

Now I just need to actually keep posting to it on a semi-regular basis.
