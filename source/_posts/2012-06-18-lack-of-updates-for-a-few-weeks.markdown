I've attracted some people who are following the progress of this project, so I figured I should give a quick update on my (lack of) progress.

I'm in the middle of organizing a wedding reception, so there won't be any time for working on my projects until after the 26th of June. I look forward to getting back to it!

So far, updates have been on a weekly schedule. I intend to continue with that pace - or maybe biweekly, depending on how much time I have. Right before this lack of updates began, I started prototyping a game based on some of the same concepts, but with a smaller scope. I might pursue that so that I have a playable, "done" game at an earlier point. If so, it'll be featured in an upcoming post. :)

Thank you all for your feedback and interest! This is exactly why I publish this publicly!
