Here's the first "dev diary" video for Arcane Deathmatch.

{% youtube cYxfSR7fj2Q %}

So far the game has:

* Working networking
* Simple network lobby
* Basic UI - leaderboard, spell shop
* Three initial spells (magic missile, infernal nova, teleport)
* A very boring level
* A reward system for kills
* A round system with a "last man standing" victory condition
