About a week ago I started playing around with [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com), trying to learn the ropes of the engine so that I could start making a game with it. This is that game: **Dungeon Fodder**.


Dungeon Fodder will be a dungeon crawler, inspired by great games like [Nethack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethack), [Gauntlet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(1985_video_game)) and [Cannon Fodder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Fodder_(video_game)) (!). While it'll be a learning project, I'll also focus on having my mechanics playable and *fun* as soon and often as possible.


It'll be in the third person, hopefully feature a small group of adventurers (like Cannon Fodder), fast paced and action-oriented.


First up: Simple dungeon rendering, camera & control. :-)
