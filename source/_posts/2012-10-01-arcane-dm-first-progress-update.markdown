While work is keeping me busy, over the past few weeks I've had a couple of good evenings to work on Arcane Deathmatch.

Last weekend I poked around with a second spell, "Infernal Nova":

This Saturday I added a leader board, a gold reward when you kill someone, and fixed some bugs. Tonight I added a UI for shopping spells, made the leader board prettier, and added a Teleport spell. Woo! Check it out below:

Hopefully I'll keep making steady progress and I can start very very early tests against real people this week or next.
